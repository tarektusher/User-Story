# User-Stories 

## What is User Story?
In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. A user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.

User stories are often recorded on index cards, on Post-it notes, or in project management software. Depending on the project, user stories may be written by various stakeholders such as clients, users, managers or development team members.

## User Stories - INVEST
The acronym INVEST helps to remember a widely accepted set of criteria, or checklist, to assess the quality of a user story. If the story fails to meet one of these criteria, the team may want to reword it, or even consider a rewrite (which often translates into physically tearing up the old story card and writing a new one).

A good user story should be - INVEST:

Independent: Should be self-contained in a way that allows to be released without depending on one another.
Negotiable: Only capture the essence of user's need, leaving room for conversation. User story should not be written like contract.
Valuable: Delivers value to end user.
Estimable: User stories have to able to be estimated so it can be properly prioritized and fit into sprints.
Small: A user story is a small chunk of work that allows it to be completed in about 3 to 4 days.
Testable: A user story has to be confirmed via pre-written acceptance criteria.

## How to Write User Stories?
When getting started with writing user stories, a template can help ensure that you don't inadvertently start writing technical tasks:

## User Story Template
User stories only capture the essential elements of a requirement:

Who it is for?
What it expects from the system?
Why it is important (optional?)?
Here is a simple format of user story used by 70% of practitioners:


Role - The user should be an actual human who interacts with the system.

Be as specific as possible
The development team is NOT a user
Action - The behavior of the system should be written as an action.

Usually unique for each User Story
The "system" is implied and does not get written in the story
Active voice, not passive voice ("I can be notified")
Benefits - The benefit should be a real-world result that is non-functional or external to the system.

Many stories may share the same benefit statement.
The benefit may be for other users or customers, not just for the user in the story.

Notes:

User stories are written in everyday language and describe a specific goal (what) from the perspective of an individual (who) along with the reason (why) he/she wants it.

In software development, the goal is often a new product feature, the individual is some type of end-user and the reason is the benefit that the user sees in the targeted product feature.

## Lifecycle of a User Story
In a broad sense, there are six main states for each user story throughout a software project:

Pending
Through the communication between user and project team, user stories are found. At this state, the user stories have nothing more than a short description of user's need. There is no detailed discussion of requirements, no system logic and no screen design yet. In fact, the only purpose of user story, for now, is just for reminding all parties for a future discussion of user's request written in this user story (card). It is possible that the user story will be discarded in the future.

To-do
Through a discussion between different stakeholders, the user stories to be addressed in the next few weeks are decided, and are put into a time-box called a sprint. Such user stories are said to be in the to-do state. No detailed discussion has yet been carried out in this state.

Discussing
When a user story is in the Discussing state, the end user will communicate to the development team in confirming the requirements as well as to define the acceptance criteria. Development team will write down the requirements or any decisions as conversation notes. UX specialist may create wireframes or storyboards to let user preview the proposed features in visual mock-ups, and to feel it. This process is known as user experience design (UX design).

Developing
After the requirements are clarified, the development team will design and implement the features to fulfill user's requests.

Confirming
Upon the development team has implemented a user story, the user story will be confirmed by the end user. He/she will be given access to the testing environment or a semi-complete software product (sometimes known as an alpha version) for confirming the feature. Confirmation will be performed based on the confirmation items written when detailing the user story. Until the confirmation is done, the user story is said to be in the Confirming state.

Finished
Finally, the feature is confirmed to be done, the user story is considered in the Finished state. Typically, this is the end of the user story. If user has a new requirement, either it is about a new feature, or it is an enhancement of the finished user story, the team would create a new user story for the next iteration.

Organizing User Stories with Story Map
User stories is a useful way to build a better product backlog, one that is user-centric and describes software requirements in a practical, actionable way. But user stories on their own do not reveal the whole picture that can clue you in on the larger journey the user goes through from the moment that load an app until they reach their final goal.

A user story map can help us to arrange user stories into a manageable model for plan, understand and organize the functionality of the system systematically. By manipulating the structure of the map, we can identify holes and omissions in your backlog and interrelating the user stories in a meaning structure; helping plan holistic releases effectively that deliver value to users and business with each release. User story map allows you to add a second dimension to your backlog. Here are a few reasons you should consider using this technique:

It allows you to see the big picture in your backlog.
It gives you a better tool for making decisions about grooming and prioritizing your backlog.
It promotes silent brainstorming and a collaborative approach to generating your user stories.
It encourages an iterative development approach where your early deliveries validate your architecture and solution.
It is a great visual alternative to traditional project plans.
It is a useful model for discussing and managing scope.
Allows you to visualize dimensional planning and real options for your project/product.
