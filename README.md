# User-Stories 

## What is User Story?
In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. A user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.

User stories are often recorded on index cards, on Post-it notes, or in project management software. Depending on the project, user stories may be written by various stakeholders such as clients, users, managers or development team members.

## User Stories - INVEST
The acronym INVEST helps to remember a widely accepted set of criteria, or checklist, to assess the quality of a user story. If the story fails to meet one of these criteria, the team may want to reword it, or even consider a rewrite (which often translates into physically tearing up the old story card and writing a new one).

Negotiable: Only capture the essence of user's need, leaving room for conversation. User story should not be written like contract.
Valuable: Delivers value to end user.
Estimable: User stories have to able to be estimated so it can be properly prioritized and fit into sprints.
Small: A user story is a small chunk of work that allows it to be completed in about 3 to 4 days.
Testable: A user story has to be confirmed via pre-written acceptance criteria.
