# User-Stories 

## What is User Story?
In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. A user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.

User stories are often recorded on index cards, on Post-it notes, or in project management software. Depending on the project, user stories may be written by various stakeholders such as clients, users, managers or development team members.

## User Stories - INVEST
The acronym INVEST helps to remember a widely accepted set of criteria, or checklist, to assess the quality of a user story. If the story fails to meet one of these criteria, the team may want to reword it, or even consider a rewrite (which often translates into physically tearing up the old story card and writing a new one).

A good user story should be - INVEST:

Independent: Should be self-contained in a way that allows to be released without depending on one another.
Negotiable: Only capture the essence of user's need, leaving room for conversation. User story should not be written like contract.
Valuable: Delivers value to end user.
Estimable: User stories have to able to be estimated so it can be properly prioritized and fit into sprints.
Small: A user story is a small chunk of work that allows it to be completed in about 3 to 4 days.
Testable: A user story has to be confirmed via pre-written acceptance criteria.

## How to Write User Stories?
When getting started with writing user stories, a template can help ensure that you don't inadvertently start writing technical tasks:

## User Story Template
User stories only capture the essential elements of a requirement:

Who it is for?
What it expects from the system?
Why it is important (optional?)?
Here is a simple format of user story used by 70% of practitioners:


Role - The user should be an actual human who interacts with the system.

Be as specific as possible
The development team is NOT a user
Action - The behavior of the system should be written as an action.

Usually unique for each User Story
The "system" is implied and does not get written in the story
Active voice, not passive voice ("I can be notified")
Benefits - The benefit should be a real-world result that is non-functional or external to the system.

Many stories may share the same benefit statement.
The benefit may be for other users or customers, not just for the user in the story.

Notes:

User stories are written in everyday language and describe a specific goal (what) from the perspective of an individual (who) along with the reason (why) he/she wants it.

In software development, the goal is often a new product feature, the individual is some type of end-user and the reason is the benefit that the user sees in the targeted product feature.
